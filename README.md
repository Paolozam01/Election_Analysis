# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:

For this challenge I was asked help Tom code a program which could determin the elections results for the state of Colorado. In order to help Tom I created a program which does the following things:

-Calculates the total number of votes cast.

-Gets the complete list of candidates who received votes.

-Calculates the total number of votes for each candidate.

-Calculates the percentage of votes for each candidate.

-Determines the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Resources:

-Data Source: election_results.csv

-Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio 1.69.1

## Election-Audit Results:

After coding the program and running it in order to analyze the elections I got the following results:

1. The total amount of votes cast was 369.711

2. The results of the elections for each of the counties was the following:

Jefferson had 10.5% of the votes (38,855 total votes).

Denver had 82.8% of the votes (306,055 total votes).

Arapahoe had 6.7% of the votes (24,801 total votes).

3. County with the largest number of votes: 

Denver.

4. The results of the elections on each candidate was the follwing:

-Charles Casper Stockham recived 23.0% of the vote (85,213 total votes).

-Diana DeGette recived 73.8% of the vote (272,892 total votes).

-Raymon Anthony Doane recived 3.1% ot the vote (11,606 total votes). 

5. Winner of the elections:

Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the vote (272,892 total votes).

## Election-Audit Summary:

The election commission now has a great program which can be used for different elections that might take place in the future. One example of this might be this same elections the next time. The only thing that would have to be done is change the list of candidates and update the vote id. This way they can run the program once again getting the same data but with the new candidates. For this example the counties list does not has to be changed since it will remain the same but it is also possible to use the same program with a different election with different counties. The only thing that would need to change would be the candidates list and the county list in order to have the updated information on the new election. This is a very fast way to determin election results and analyze this results.
